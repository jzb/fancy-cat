# Fancy Cat Linux

This is a repository for playing with Bazzite custom images; I've called it "Fancy Cat Linux" in homage to my [late, great tuxedo cat Lilah](https://jzb.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lilah-21-oct-2010.jpg). Feel free to try it out, but beware that this is a one-person experiment that could break or be abandoned at any time. You probably are better off just doing your own thing with the Universal Blue images.

# image-template

This repository is based on the [ublue-os image template](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template). See that link for creating your own ublue-os image.
